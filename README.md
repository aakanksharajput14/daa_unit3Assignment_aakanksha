## SECTION A – Short Theory [15 Marks]

1) DP essentials  
- List the three ingredients of DP and one-line purpose of each. 
  
   Ans:  - Optimal Substructure: Optimal solution is built from optimal solutions of subproblems.  
         - Overlapping Subproblems: Same subproblems repeat; solve once and reuse.  
         - State & Transition: Define DP state and recurrence to compute and store results efficiently.  

---
2) DP vs D&C  
- State two differences focusing on subproblem overlap and reuse; give one example for each. 

    Ans: DP: Overlapping subproblems and results reused using memoization/tabulation.  
             Example: Fibonacci using DP.  
        - Divide & Conquer:Subproblems independent; recomputation occurs.  
             Example: Merge Sort.

3) Principle of optimality  
- Define it in one sentence and name any one problem satisfying it.
